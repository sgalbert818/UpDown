Up Down Arcade Website

The arcade website is a dynamic and visually appealing site designed to provide an engaging experience for visitors. Inspired by shortcomings of the arcade's existing website, this project aims to enhance engagement and showcase the arcade's offerings in a modern and attractive manner.

This project was created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
